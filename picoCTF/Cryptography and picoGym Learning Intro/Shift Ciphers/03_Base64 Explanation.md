Base64 encoding allows raw binary data to be represented as printable ASCII characters. It’s not an encryption method, it can always be easily decoded. It can serve as a mild form of obfuscation. CTF (Capture-the-flag) problem writers often use this feature of Base64 to hide otherwise trivially discoverable flags, such as when using grep to search for the “picoCTF” flag prefix. Base64 encoded information can be given away by trailing equal signs (“=”), but Base64 encoded strings don’t always have this feature. A good tool for encoding and decoding Base64 (and many other things) is CyberChef.
